ASCII
======
It is a 7-bit encoding .Using 7 bits gives 128 possible values from 0000000 to 1111111, 
so ASCII has enough room for all lower case and upper case Latin letters, along with each 
numerical digit, common punctuation marks, spaces, tabs and other control characters.

UNICODE
========
create a single character set that could represent every characters.
rather than use a number, each character was represented as a code-point.

UTF-8
======
In UTF-8, every code-point from 0â€“127 is stored in a single byte. 
Code points above 128 are stored using 2, 3, and in fact, up to 6 bytes.

UTF-16
======
UTF-16, in the other hand, uses a minimum of 16 bits (or 2 bytes) to encode the unicode characters.
A Java char (Character) is thus a UTF-16 encoded unicode character and occupies a memory space of 2 bytes. 

1's & 2's Complement
====================
1's complement of a binary number is another binary number which can obtain
by toggling all bits in it, i.e., transforming the 0 bit to 1 and the 1 bit to 0. 

2's complement of a binary number can be obtained by adding 1 to the 1's complement of the binary number.
