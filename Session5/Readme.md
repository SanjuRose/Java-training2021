=====================
		OOPS
=====================
The Object Oriented Programming approach is very close to the real world objects and real time applications. It is faster
than procvedural approach . It is possible to create reusable applications using OOPs concept. 
The main features of OOPs are 
1. Class & Objects
2. Data Abstraction
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance 


=====================================
			Class & objects
=====================================
It is the main feature of OOPs concept. It is a user defined datatype.
It consists of several variables & functions. Its purpose is to store data & information. 
It is not visible so needed objects which is the implementation of class.
So classes are the blueprint of objects. 

=====================================
	Data Abstraction (Data Hiding) 
=====================================
It is the representation of features without including any background details or explanation.
It displays essential information and hiding the details.

=====================================
		Encapsulation
=====================================
It is defined as the wrapping up of data and related methods in a single unit (eg; a class)
No need to worry about implementation but operations. simply use the method. (eg; Date & time)
With this approach we can update class without worrying about the methods using them. 

=====================================
		Inheritance
=====================================
It is the ability of a class to use properties of another class (parent class).
It reduces the redundancy ie, no need to write the properties again and again.
